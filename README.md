Testing ... 

This project set-up instructions are inside another banking system repo ! minus the first paragraph :)

--Pay attention to what branch you are in / file location too sometimes
    otherwise no changes will happen when
    you try to push or pull ! ugh location location location !
--Changes on remote files reflect on the local one
    ONLY WHEN I use the Intellij software. 
    The terminal is not letting me PULL CHANGES !
    I will always look to see how to fix this !
    Now, let's see if we can push changes to this file
    using terminal VS using Intellij

    Testing if we can pull changes now using terminal ... ! since I set the upstream using the command:
     "git push --set-upstream origin main" (NEW)

--OK I fixed it !
    The solution is to make sure we SET A WAY TO CONNECT LOCAL REPO WITH REMOTE
    REPO + FOR PULLING/PUSHING FOR BRANCHES.

--COME BACK TO THIS file WHEN STUCK !
    Now ... sometimes the Terminal (Linux) works and OTHER TIMES, Intellij works instead. Oh well. Let's keep going.
